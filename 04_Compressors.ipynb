    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic range compression is an important concept within music production, and is used extensively throughout the production and mixing process. Compression can be used to subtlely maintain a consistent level on a recording, or at its extremes squash a signal until it produces noticeable distortion and artefacts, among many other more creative uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll dicuss:\n",
    "- how and why a compressor might used\n",
    "- the characteristics that are important to the design of a compressor and that differentiate one compressor from another\n",
    "- how a compressor works (with some interactive graphics!)\n",
    "- how to implement a basic compressor (with working and complete code examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many of the code examples in this notebook are intended to be readable rather than performant, so you may wish to make changes before attempting to use these examples in your own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of compressors\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, the main goal of a compressor is to reduce the dynamic range of the audio it is processing. In other words, a compressor reduces the volume difference between the loudest parts of an audio signal and the quietest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important technique particularly for recordings such as vocals and bass guitar, which typically have a large variance in volume (the dynamic range) which from one moment to the next may be a little too loud for the mix or a little too quiet. This is where compression can be used to level out the peaks and troughs in the volume of the signal, so that it sits nicely and consistently with other elements of a mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to approach the problem of dynamic range compression:\n",
    "- **Downward compression**: Reduce the volume of everything that *exceeds* a threshold\n",
    "- **Upward compression**: Increase the volume of everything that falls *below* a threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically both types of compressor will then apply a \"makeup\" gain to the entire signal which controls the output level of the compressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of compression that is applied to a signal above (in the case of a downward compressor) or below (in the case of an upward compressor) the threshold is determined by a *ratio* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, most popular compressors you are likely to see in use fall into the downward compression category, with upward compression being used very rarely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way a compressor applies its volume reduction can be visualised by plotting a graph of input amplitude on the x-axis and output amplitude on the y-axis as below:"

    "In the case of the downward compressor, at input volumes below a **threshold** no compression is applied, therefore the output amplitude equals the input amplitude. But at input amplitudes above the **threshold** the gain reduction is applied. The amount of gain reduction is described as a **ratio**, such as 2:1, 4:1, etc. This means that when the input amplitude exceeds the threshold, the output amplitude will be equal to everything below the threshold, *plus* everything above the threshold divided by the ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the upward compressor you can see the opposite is true, with the signal being *multiplied* by the ratio when below the threshold, but passed through unchanged when above the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this simple dynamic range adjustment is not all that compressors are used for, with many models of analogue compressor becaming famous because of their imperfections which lead them to do a little more to a signal than just reduce its dynamic range. These imperfections may cause the compressor to affect different frequency ranges differently or introduce a small level or distortion, in turn changing the frequency content of a signal by a small amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important feature of a compressor which we've not yet mentioned is the **attack** and **release** time. These parameters control how quickly the compressor applies the volume reduction after the input amplitude has exceeded the threshold, and for how long it continues to apply the volume reduction after the input amplitude has dropped back below the threshold (or vice versa for an upwards compressor).\n",
    "\n",
    "These controls are very important to controlling the behaviour of the compressor, for example a slower attack allows more of the initial transient of a sound to pass through before triggering the compressor, and slower release will cause the compressor to hang on to a sound for longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of compressor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogue\n",
    "\n",
    "Until recent years, all compressors were what we would consider to be analogue compressors. This means the compressor would be a physical piece of hardware (often rackmounted), and would use an electrical circuit to apply the compression. This type of compressor is still in widespread use today, and several models of analogue compressor have become sought-after enough to warrant software emulations of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main areas that these compressors differentiated themselves from the competition was in the implementation of their compression circuits, the most popular of which can roughly be grouped as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                | Optical                                                        | FET                                  | VCA                                                 |\n",
    "| :------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |\n",
    "| Character      | Often described as \"warm\" or \"colourful\", noticable distortion | Less colourful, less distortion      | Usually very clean, minimal colouration             |\n",
    "| Attack/Release | Typically slowest                                              | Faster                               | Often equally capable at slow and fast times        |\n",
    "| Application    | Popular for vocals, melodic instruments                        | Often used on vocals, guitars, drums | Bus compressors                                     |\n",
    "| As seen in     | Teletronicx LA-2A and LA-3A                                    | UREI 1176                            | Focusrite Red, dbx 160, SSL G master bus compressor |\n",
    "\n",
    "*Some of the statements above are broad generalisations of each design, and you are likely to find examples of each which contradict these*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years digital compressors have become much more popular, due to lower cost, new design possibilties, and multiple possible form factors. One of the key advantages of a digital compressor is the it can be built not only as a rack unit, but also a VST plugin, standalone software, or integrated into a digital effects unit or pedalboard alongside dozens of other effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital compression also opens up many possibilities in terms of how a compressor can sound, since the design is no longer limited by the components which makeup the circuit but rather how much can be computed while keeping the latency low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, in recent years all kinds of software based compressors have been created, with some aiming to be super accurate models of the previously mentioned analogue compressors (often with a few added improvements), some aiming to be the cleanest, fastest, and most transparent compressor, and others going in their own direction to reimagine what a compressor can sound like.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other compressor based devices\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go any further and start looking into the implementation of a basic compression algorithm, you may come across a few other devices that perform a similar function to a compressor which are worth briefly mentioning. This isn't an exhaustive list, but contains the most common of these devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limiters\n",
    "\n",
    "A limiter is typically a specialised version of a downward compressor, usually with a very high ratio. These devices are often used where an audio signal needs to be prevented from significantly exceeding the threshold, and are a staple of most mastering processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiband compressors\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiband compressor works by first using several crossover filters to split a signal into two or more frequency bands and then passing the resulting signals to separate compressors. For example in a 3 band multiband compressor, you would have one compressor for the lowest frequencies, one compressor for those in the middle, and another for the highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most implementations the compressors of each band can function independently, with their own controls for threshold, ratio, etc. The frequency range which each compressor is responsible for is often also controllable by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### De-essers\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually used to reduce sibilance in vocal recordings, a de-esser is often implemented as a compressor which only operates on a particular frequency range. In this way it can limit the amplitude of the frequencies in the range within which the sibilence is occurring by applying compression to only those frequncies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expanders\n",
    "\n",
    "An expander is effectively a device which does the opposite of a compressor, and increases the dynamic range of an audio signal rather than trying to reduce it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Much of this section is based on the paper [Digital Dynamic Range Compressor Design - A Tutorial and Analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277772168_Digital_Dynamic_Range_Compressor_Design-A_Tutorial_and_Analysis), which I recommend reading for additional details)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know a little about what compressors do and how they're used, we can start looking at how to actually build one. In most compressors there are two key components: the level detector, and the gain computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between these two the gain reduction applied to the signal is calculated, and we'll look at how these work exactly very soon. First though we need a higher level view of how these components can be arranged, in either feedforward or feedback designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedforward vs feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Both analogue and digital compressors can be implemented using feedforward or feedback designs. Below you can see a simplified diagram of the signal chain of a feedforward design:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jd-13/dsp-math-for-audio/master/assets/compressors/simpleFeedforward.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The process can be summarised as the following steps:\n",
    "1. Input is split between being routed to the output and the level detector\n",
    "2. Level detector generates a signal representing the amplitude of the input\n",
    "3. Gain computer takes the output of the level detector, and checks it against the parameters (threshold, ratio, etc) and decides how much gain reduction should be applied\n",
    "4. Gain is applied to the original signal before it reaches the output\n",
    "\n",
    "A feedback design uses the same components as a feedforward design, but as you can see below it does the steps in a slightly different order:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jd-13/dsp-math-for-audio/master/assets/compressors/simpleFeedback.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the same process has occured as in the feedforward design, but this time we're using the signal after it has already been compressed to drive the level detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern compressors are based on a feedforward design as it allows for the implementation of lookahead, and perfect limiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback designs were often used in early analogue compressors as they reduce the dynamic range which the level detector and gain computer must be able to operate effectively on, since they only see the input signal after its dynamic range has already been reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In digital compressors this is no longer a concern, so for the remainder of this notebook we will be focusing on feedforward designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the level detector is the start of the chain, this is where we'll start with our implementaion\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've read the previous notebooks on envelope followers (part 1 [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jd-13/dsp-math-for-audio/blob/master/02_Envelope-Followers.ipynb), and part 2 [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jd-13/dsp-math-for-audio/blob/master/03_Envelope-Followers-Part-2.ipynb)) then this section may seem familiar. The process of performing level detection is conceptually very similar to that of an envelope follower - an input signal is provided, and from it another signal describing how it's amplitude changes is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also like envelope followers they provide attack and release times which can be controlled by the user, which controls how quickly the produced signal rises and falls while tracking the amplitude of the input signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common methods of level detection used in compressors: root-mean-squared (RMS) and peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __RMS__: Provides a smoothed average of the signal that more closely represents the perceived loudness, but introduces a latency in order to calculate the average\n",
    "* __Peak__: Follows the amplitude of the signal without any averaging, this is the most commonly used method in compressors\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll look at two possible implementations, and plot their outputs to compare their performance. Let's first look at a simple implementation of a peak level detector:"

This is why we use abs() when checking the distance from the threshold, and again why we divide the knee width by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maths in this branch might look a little more complex, but it will make sense after some thought. Let's start by considering what will happen when the input level is only *just* high enough to be affected by the knee, so sits at the lower boundary of the knee. In this case the following is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ input level = threshold - \\frac{knee width}{2} $\n",

    "Now for the other end of this equation, when the input level is not *quite* high enough to escape the knee, so sits at the upper boundary of the knee. In this case the following is true:\n",

    "$ input level = threshold + \\frac{knee width}{2} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's substitute this into the equation for this branch as we did before:\n",

    "$ output = input level + (\\frac{1}{ratio} - 1)(input level - threshold + \\frac{knee width}{2})^2\\frac{1}{2 * knee width} $\n",

    "$ output = input level + (\\frac{1}{ratio} - 1)knee width^2\\frac{1}{2 * knee width} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ output = input level + (\\frac{1}{ratio} - 1)\\frac{knee width}{2} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at this point it's not exactly clear how to simplify this such that it matches the equation for the branch above the knee, so we'll substitute the same value of input level into that equation for the upper branch and attempt to meet in the middle:\n",

    "$ output = threshold + \\frac{input level - threshold}{ratio} $\n",
    "\n",

    "$ output = input level + (\\frac{1}{ratio} - 1)\\frac{knee width}{2} $\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So now we know that this middle branch in the code meets both the lower and the upper branches of the code at exactly the same values at its boundaries, and in between them the use of the $ x^2 $ term (`pow()` in the code) provides a curve which transitions between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Level is above threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "If the level isn't way below the threshold, and isn't in the transition covered by the knee, then it must be far enough above the threshold to have the full compression ratio applied.\n",

    "As you can see, the gain reduction applied by the log domain compressor starts its attack slightly ahead of the simple compressor, and its release is initially a little faster but has a much smoother tail. This gives it a more natural sound with less distortion of the input signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've reached the end of the notebook I really recommend adjusting some of the parameters and watching how the shape of the gain reduction curves change, this should provide a better intuition of how these two algorithms are performing.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have seen how compressors are used and how they can be implemented using a few mathematical concepts that I hope now make sense. The reasoning behind a few of the common design desisions and their impacts on the performance of a compressor should also now be a little clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log domain compressor implementation demonstrated here is not necessarily the best design, as there are plenty of other approaches which have their own performance characteristics that may suit your use case better. It does however provide a reasonable starting point for a first implementation, and may do just fine depending on the goals of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for further ideas to study in this domain I would recommend looking into a few of the other compressor based devices that were mentioned earlier in this notebook, and also having a look through some of the further reading resources listed below. There is also a whole world of analogue modelling which is often applied to digital compressors which maybe of interest.\n",
