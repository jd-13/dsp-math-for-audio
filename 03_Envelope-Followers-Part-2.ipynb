This also allows you to play with the code samples inline with the rest of the notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the [previous notebook](https://github.com/jd-13/dsp-math-for-audio) we looked at how several different types of envelope filter work, and concluded that most of them use a rectification stage of some sort followed by a low pass filter. The content of the previous notebook was focused mostly on the performance impacts of using different rectification stages, but what about the filter stage?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll look at how changing the filter stage of an envelope follower affects its performance, and for consistency we'll use an envelope follower with a real square law rectification stage throughout the examples in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's review how a real square law envelope follower works:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jd-13/dsp-math-for-audio/master/assets/envelope-followers/realSquareLaw.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In any envelope follower like the one above, the frequency response of the filter being used determines the responsiveness of the envelope follower, often described as the attack and release time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed from the code in the previous notebook, when controlling the attack and release times we're actually controlling the coefficients of the filter, therefore changing it's frequency response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attenuating higher frequencies more results in a smoother but slower response, while passing through more high frequencies creates a faster response with more ripple. Now, let's look at a demonstration of this using a real square law envelope follower.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is the same as we have seen from the end of the previous notebook, however the attack and release controls have been replaced with direct control over the cutoff frequency of the filter. You can also control the frequency of the input signal to see how the envelope follower responds to different frequencies."

    "Let's compare the behaviours we can see in the above example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chebyshev\n",
    "The envelope followers built from the first order Butterworth and Chebyshev both behave identically, but the third order ones are a little different. The Chebyshev produces a longer attack and release time as expected, but actually introduces more ripple due to the ripple in the Chebyshev's passband.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elliptic\n",
    "Again, the envelope follower built from a first order elliptic filter behaves the same as the first order Butterworth and Chebyshev, but the third order filter is more interesting. It shows a lot more ripple, and actually has a slightly faster attack than the Chebyshev or Butterworth - possibly because the ripple in the stop band actually reduces its attenuation of high frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bessel\n",
    "As expected, an envelope follower built from a Bessel filter behaves very similarly to the Butterworth, with the third order variant having just a slightly slower response and a slightly smaller peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This was just a quick introduction to how your choice of filter can affect the way your envelope follower behaves. We've seen from the demonstrations that both the order and type of an envelope follower's filter stage are important factors, with a general rule being:\n",
    "\n",
    "    More attenuation of high frequencies = slower response, less ripple\n",
