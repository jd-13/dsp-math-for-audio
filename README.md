# DSP Math for Audio

Understanding the applications of certain parts of DSP math to music and audio processing is something that I've often found quite difficult as many resources seem to be fragmented or focused on only the applications within control systems. I'll be using this repo to share jupyter notebooks that I've written to aid my own understanding of these concepts, and in particular I'll focus on embedding interactive code samples and visualisations within the notebooks which I've often found useful.
