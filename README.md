# DSP Math for Audio

Understanding the applications of certain parts of DSP math to music and audio processing is
something that I've often found quite difficult, as many resources seem to be fragmented or focused
on only the applications within control systems.

I'll be using this repo to share jupyter notebooks that I've written to aid my own understanding of
these concepts, and in particular I'll focus on embedding interactive code samples and
visualisations within the notebooks.

For the best experience I recommend installing [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) and running
the notebooks locally on your own machine, however it is also possible to run them online using
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).
